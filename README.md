the Philippine Science High School's environment for reserving venues and the facilities within them [Butaran, 2017]

**NOTE:** This web app was intended to be run on a server that is in the same time zone as the users, so there is no time zone support, as it was intented to be a private project. If all users are in the same time zone and the server is in another, use [this PHP function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-set.php) at the top part of `main.php` to change it. It all users are not in the same time zone it is not supported and the code must be changed more.

### Requirements

**Server:**

* Web server with PHP
* MySQL

**Client:**

* A modern browser
